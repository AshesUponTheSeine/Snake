# Snake

Ncurses implementation of the game snake that I made over the course of two lunch breaks at my job with my Android phone and a bluetooth keyboard. I'll admit I had to add in the input queueing afterwards.

It still has some potential for improvement, but is certainly in a playable state right now.

This was my first attempt at an asynchronous ncurses game. I'll soon be in China without my laptop for over a month, so I wanted to get some practice with this sort of thing so I can make more complex games in my spare time (since I'll only really be able to make terminal applications when coding on my phone).
